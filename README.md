# GitHub-Automation-using-Python
I'm writing a Medium blog where I post one LeetCode SQL solution every day. Check it out! 💻[Link to my Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@asvithavs)

👉 I was also planning to upload all of my blog links to GitHub, 
    but I was bored of opening and uploading them manually. 🤷‍♀️ 
👉 So, I decided to automate the process using Python. 🐍
